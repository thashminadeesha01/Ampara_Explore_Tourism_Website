    aboutParagraphs: [
      "Engineered in 1949 as the crowning achievement of the Gal Oya Development Scheme spearheaded by independent Sri Lanka's first Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, this reservoir covers an astounding water spread of over 7,800 hectares (nearly 77 square kilometers). Far more than an irrigation masterwork, it endured essential civil engineering principles that transformed the parched scrub plains of the East into a flourishing sanctuary.",
      "What makes Senanayake Samudraya globally singular is its status as Sri Lanka's premier open-water boat safari destination. Hemmed in by the jagged granite silhouette of Mount Inginiyagala and Dimbula, peaceful motorized dinghies navigate tranquil lake channels where wild Asian elephants swim between wooded islets. In the serene morning mist, rare White-bellied Sea Eagles dive into the mirrors of water, while Native cormorants dry their plumage atop petrified forest trunks that rise gracefully from the deep basin.",
